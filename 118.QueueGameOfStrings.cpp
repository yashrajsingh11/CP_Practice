// Approach : Create a priority queue which keeps the character with largest frequency at the top. For all characters when a new 
// character is seen if it is already present increment its value else add it to the heap. Now max-heapify the heap k times while 
// decrementing the top value by 1 each time. Square sum the remaining elements of heap.
